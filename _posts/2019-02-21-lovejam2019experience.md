# WHAT'S THE JAM?

---

> The bread alone is not sufficient for those who hunger, a jam is required.

So, with that nonsensical quotation let us jam-p *pun intended* to the matter. Love Jam 2019 was a success!

What's the [Love Jam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/love2d-jam-2019)? Just click on your question.

The optional theme was **FRICTION**, and I daresay that it was indeed optional for my entry since I poorly integrated it with my game. I always thought that the main theme of the jam was **love** so my entry is aptly named **Love to the Rescue!**. Ofcourse, I also wanted to throw some references and easter eggs to the game by naming a character **Command Seven** and the main boss, and only enemy, **Slime**.

Oh by the way, here's the link to game [Love to the Rescue!](https://brbl.itch.io/love-to-the-rescue). If you want the source code, here you go, go nuts with it in [Github](https://github.com/flamendless/love-jam-2019)

# WHAT DID I LEARN?

---

> As I tasted the sweet strawberry jam, I fell in endless bliss.

Well, a lot of things.

That's it. Thanks for reading!

Just kidding.

I learned two things that I really need to consider for a long time, maybe like a month or so. First, let us break some terms down:

* **Indie Game Developer** - because it is your passion or hobby
* **Professional Game Developer** - because it is your job
* **Professional Indie Game Developer** - because it is your passion or hobby and you are paid by doing it.

I consider myself to be under the **fourth category**, what is that fourth category you ask? It is **70% Indie and 30% Professional Game Developer**, basically, I want and enjoy making games but I also in need of income (who does not?).

For Pros, there has to be some organization and code reusability and perfection in writing codes. Since commonly they work within a team or studio and has to deal with other people's other preference like **spaces over tabs** and so on. Unlike Indies who are commonly and usually doing it solo, where code looks and performance are not the leading issues and of importance. There is a lot of differences between the Pros and the Indies which I do not want to enumerate and list here for sanity's sake.

The problem I had after publishing [Going Home](https://gamejolt.com/games/goinghome/237280) is that when I reflected on its codebase, it turned me into a programmer, not a game developer (you can read more about that [here](https://flamendless.github.io/gamedev/2018/01/08/going-home-remake/)). So instead of making games, I tend to desire and struggle with:

* Code looks - when other people see my code they will go **WOW!**
* Project organization - every file, every everything must be categorized and ordered properly, intensively, and insanely over too much.
* Code usage - how I use my own libraries and source files should be clean and beautiful and perfect.
* and more

Yes, those points are not inherently bad, but those get on my way so I consider them bad and not helpful. Those points are helpful and good on the long run, i.e after a year when I look back at the code. But let us face it, the only two reasons I could possibly look back on my old game's source code are:
		
* I have to fix a bug
* I have to update it (new version of framework that breaks compatibility)

I struggle also with the fact that my game should be like **game engine-y**. I always want to have those fancy visual debugger stuff like in Unity and Jonathan Blows' Sokoban game, but the problem is, **I do not have to, I just want to**, which defeats the purpose of my hobby.

# THE QUESTION

---

Ask yourself, do you want to make a game? or do you want to make a software?

I learned this during the jam, I want to make a game within 72 hours (3 days) and so I have to stop thinking about a lot of stuff like separation of classes and data, integrating dearimgui, and code looks (this is my general term of a lot of things). I want people to play my **output** and not my input **source code**.

I always remind that question to myself whenever I am coding so I won't lose track of the goal.


# THE BREAKDOWN

---

> Eating too much jam will jam-ble the brain.

Huh? Yes.

Midway of the jam, I had a breakdown.

I lost the desire to code anymore.

I lost the energy to keep on coding.

I lost the motivation to make a game.

Now, let me clear things out, I was not physically tired since I have proper rest during the jam. Not mentally tired since we had no classes in school so I have a lot of time than I have expected and prepared for, also, I planned the game properly beforehand.

I was tired emotionally. I was in need of someone to talk to, the fact that I do not have anyone to talk to (except for my family of course, but we teenagers do not talk to them about most of the stuff) for a very long time is saddening. Where is social media when you need it, right?

To somehow get on track and to help myself during that time, I recorded myself talking to myself, like a blog or stream. I was going to include that as an overlay video to the [timelapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckCshKBekOE). But in the end, I did not want to because I might become a meme or be targeted of social media bullying and so on.

Somehow, that worked, I feel good and relieved even though I am talking to myself.

I am okay now, do not worry.
