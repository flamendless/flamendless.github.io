Hi all! My name is **Brandon Blanker Lim-it**, currently living in the Philippines.

I go by the username **flamendless** which is
a combination of ***flame*** and ***endless***,
which is a synonym of ***infinity*** and my favorite number ***eight (8)***.

But why is my favourite number ***eight (8)*** you asked?

The answer is  ***endless eight***. Do you get the reference?
