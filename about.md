Hi all! My name is <b>Brandon Blanker Lim-it</b>, currently living in the Philippines.

I go by the username <b>flamendless</b> which is
a combination of <b><i>flame</i></b> and <b><i>endless</i></b>
(which is a synonym of <b><i>infinity</i></b> and my favorite number <b><i>8</i></b>).

I am a programmer and indie game developer by heart, but also knowledgable about
web development (more of a backend developer).

The languages in order of expertise/comfort:
* **Lua**
* **C++**
* **PHP**
* **JavaScript**
* **C#**
* **Python**
* **Haxe**
* **Java** - *but I really loathe it*

The tools/setup I use:
* **Linux** - Manjaro - I3-gaps
* **Vim**
* **Git** - Sublime Merge for GUI client
* [LÃ¶ve Framework](https://love2d.org)
