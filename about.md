Hi all! My name is **Brandon Blanker Lim-it**, currently living in the Philippines.

I go by the username **flamendless** which is
a combination of ***flame*** and ***endless***,
which is a synonym of ***infinity*** and my favorite number ***eight (8)***.

But why is my favourite number ***eight (8)*** you asked?

The answer is  ***endless eight***. Do you get the reference?

I am a programmer and indie game developer by heart, but also knowledgable about
web development (more of a backend developer).

Things I can do with the computer:
* Game Development
* Software Engineering
* Database Administration
* Web Development - backend preferably

The languages in order of expertise/comfort:
* **Lua**
* **C++**
* **PHP**
* **JavaScript**
* **C#**
* **Python**
* **Haxe**
* **Java** - *but I really loathe it*

The tools/setup I use:
* **Linux** - Manjaro - I3-gaps
* **Vim**
* **Git** - Sublime Merge for GUI client
* [LÃ¶ve Framework](https://love2d.org)
